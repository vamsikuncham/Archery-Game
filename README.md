# Archery-Game

Archery Game is the popular game in olden days where the shooter gets 10 arrows and shoots the moving darboard. I divided the dartboard in 5 categories (100 points, 70 points, 50 points, 40 points and 35 points) and added sounds when the arrow hits the dartboard, but I built this game  using Computer Graphics in C using "graphic.h" library.

Instructions to run this project 
1) Install TurboC++
2) open this arrow.c file using turboc++
3) execute or run the file.
